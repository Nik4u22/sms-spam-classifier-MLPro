Email spam classification is a classic problem in machine learning, where the goal is to automatically classify an email as either "spam" or "not spam" (also known as "ham"). This is an important task because email is one of the most common communication channels and spam can be a significant problem, leading to wasted time, decreased productivity, and even security threats.

The task of email spam classification involves building a machine learning model that takes as input the content of an email and outputs a prediction of whether the email is spam or not. The model is typically trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as spam or not spam. The model then uses this training data to learn patterns in the text that are indicative of spam or not spam, and applies this knowledge to new, unseen emails to make predictions.

Some challenges in email spam classification include dealing with variations in language, avoiding false positives (i.e., classifying a legitimate email as spam), and handling large amounts of data efficiently. Therefore, the goal of an effective email spam classifier is to achieve a high level of accuracy while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Classification Problem - Tagret variable output is either spam or not spam
